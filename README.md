# The Code Card
![](images/codecard.png)

Code Card is a Wi-Fi-enabled device with an e-paper display that can retrieve content from Oracle Cloud. Code Cards are available on a first-come basis to Oracle OpenWorld and Oracle Code One attendees who sign up for a cloud trial account. Stop by the Groundbreakers Hub to sign up and start configuring your Code Card.

### How did we build the Code Card?
We partnered with [Squarofumi](http://www.sqfmi.com/), creators of [Badgy](https://www.tindie.com/products/squarofumi/badgy-iot-badge/), an IoT badge, to create the Code Card.
